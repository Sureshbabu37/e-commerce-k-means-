E-commerce Customer Segmentation Project

Description:

The E-commerce Customer Segmentation project aims to provide insights into customer behavior and preferences in an e-commerce platform. Through the analysis of customer data, the project employs various techniques such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and clustering algorithms to group customers based on their activity and preferences.

Key Features:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: The project utilizes the Pandas library to load customer data from an Excel file, preprocesses the data by handling missing values, and prepares it for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Through visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn, the project explores the distribution of features, such as gender counts, total orders, and brand-wise searches. EDA helps understand patterns and relationships within the data.

Feature Engineering: Categorical data, such as gender, is encoded using LabelEncoder from Scikit-learn to prepare it for clustering algorithms. Additionally, feature engineering involves aggregating and transforming data to derive meaningful insights.

Clustering with K-means: The project employs the K-means clustering algorithm from Scikit-learn to segment customers into distinct groups based on their behavior and preferences. The optimal number of clusters is determined using silhouette scores.

Visualization of Clusters: The project visualizes the clusters by plotting the count of searches for different brands across each cluster. This visualization helps in understanding the characteristics of each customer segment.

Educational Purpose:

The E-commerce Customer Segmentation project serves as an educational resource for data science enthusiasts and practitioners. It demonstrates the practical application of data science techniques, including data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and clustering algorithms, in solving real-world business problems. By following the project, learners gain insights into customer segmentation strategies, which are essential for personalized marketing and improving customer experience in e-commerce platforms. Additionally, the project fosters an understanding of data visualization techniques and their role in extracting actionable insights from data.

Usage:

The project is designed to be run in a Jupyter Notebook environment such as Google Colab. Users can download the provided notebook and dataset, and execute the code cells to replicate the analysis and explore customer segmentation techniques. The code is well-documented with comments and explanations to facilitate understanding and learning.
